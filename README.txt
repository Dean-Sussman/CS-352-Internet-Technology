We used Python3 for this project.

We implemented a Three-Way-Handshake to establish the connection and a 2-Double Handshake to terminate the connection. 

In the send_packets function we tried to establish the Go-Back-N protocol, but it was not compiling so we commented it out and instead have it work when no packets are dropped.
